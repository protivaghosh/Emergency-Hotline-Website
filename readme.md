## Q1: What is the difference between getElementById, getElementsByClassName, and querySelector / querySelectorAll?

### getElementById
- Selects an element by its **id**.
- Returns only **one element** (or `null` if not found).
- Example:
  ```js
  const title = document.getElementById("main-title");



### getElementsByClassName

- Selects all elements with the given class name.

- Returns an HTMLCollection (like an array but not exactly).

- It is live, meaning if new elements with that class are added later, the collection updates automatically.
- Example:
  ```js
  const items = document.getElementsByClassName("card");

## querySelector

- Selects the first element that matches a CSS selector.
- Example:
  ```js
  const firstCard = document.querySelector(".card.active");


### querySelectorAll

- Selects all elements that match a CSS selector.

- Returns a NodeList (static, does not update automatically).
- Example:
  ```js
  const allCards = document.querySelectorAll(".card");


# Q2: How to Create and Insert a New Element into the DOM

In JavaScript, you can create and insert a new element into the DOM in a few simple steps.

---

## Step 1: Create the element
Use the method `document.createElement()` to create a new HTML element.

```js
const newDiv = document.createElement("div");


Step 2: Insert into the DOM

Finally, attach the element to an existing parent node using methods like:

appendChild() â†’ Adds as the last child.

prepend() â†’ Adds as the first child.

append() â†’ Similar to appendChild but can add multiple nodes or text.

insertBefore() â†’ Inserts before a specific node.


## Q3: What is Event Bubbling and How Does it Work?

## ðŸ“Œ Definition
Event Bubbling is a concept in the DOM (Document Object Model) where an event starts from the **target element** (the element that was actually clicked or interacted with) and then **bubbles up** through its ancestors (parent, grandparent, all the way up to `document`).

In other words, when you click on a child element, the event is first handled by that child, then its parent, then the parent of the parent, and so on.

---

## ðŸ“Œ How It Works
1. Suppose you have a `div` inside another `div`.
2. When you click the inner `div`, the event fires on that element **first**.
3. After that, the same event moves upward (bubbles) to the parent element.
4. Then it continues to bubble up until it reaches the `document`.

## Q4: What is Event Delegation in JavaScript? Why is it Useful?

## ðŸ“Œ Definition
Event Delegation is a **JavaScript pattern** that allows you to handle events for **multiple child elements** by adding a single event listener to their **common parent**.  
Instead of attaching event listeners to each element individually, the parent element "listens" for events that bubble up from its children.

---

## ðŸ“Œ How It Works
- Events in JavaScript **bubble up** (child â†’ parent â†’ document).
- You attach **one listener** to a parent element.
- Inside that listener, you check which child triggered the event (using `event.target`).
- Then you execute the appropriate logic.


## Q5: What is the difference between preventDefault() and stopPropagation() methods?

## ðŸ“Œ 1. preventDefault()
- The `preventDefault()` method **prevents the default action of an element** from happening.
- It **does not stop** the event from bubbling up the DOM tree.
- Example: Preventing a link from redirecting or stopping a form from submitting.


## ðŸ“Œ 2. stopPropagation()

The stopPropagation() method prevents the event from bubbling (or trickling) up the DOM tree.

The default behavior of the element will still happen, but the event wonâ€™t move to parent elements.
